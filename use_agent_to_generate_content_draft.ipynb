Sie hilft uns dabei, die Steigung einer Funktion an einem bestimmten Punkt zu berechnen. \\n\\nUm die Ableitung einer Funktion zu bestimmen, verwenden wir den Differentialquotienten. Der Differentialquotient gibt uns die Änderungsrate der Funktion an einem bestimmten Punkt. \\n\\nUm den Differentialquotienten zu berechnen, nehmen wir zwei Punkte auf der Funktion, die sehr nahe beieinander liegen. Wir nennen diese Punkte x und x+h. Dann berechnen wir den Quotienten aus der Differenz der Funktionswerte an diesen beiden Punkten und der Differenz der x-Werte. \\n\\nDer Differentialquotient wird oft mit dem Buchstaben f'(x) oder dy/dx dargestellt. \\n\\nUm die Ableitung einer Funktion zu bestimmen, nehmen wir den Grenzwert des Differentialquotienten, wenn h gegen Null geht. Dieser Grenzwert gibt uns die Steigung der Funktion an dem Punkt x. \\n\\nDie Ableitung einer Funktion gibt uns also die Steigung der Funktion an jedem Punkt. Wenn die Ableitung positiv ist, bedeutet das, dass die Funktion an diesem Punkt steigt. Wenn die Ableitung negativ ist, bedeutet das, dass die Funktion an diesem Punkt fällt. \\n\\nDie Ableitung kann auch verwendet werden, um die Extremstellen einer Funktion zu bestimmen. An den Stellen, an denen die Ableitung Null ist oder nicht existiert, können sich Maxima oder Minima der Funktion befinden. \\n\\nDie Ableitung ist also ein sehr nützliches Werkzeug in der Mathematik, um die Steigung von Funktionen zu berechnen und Extremstellen zu finden.\", additional_kwargs={}, example=False)"
