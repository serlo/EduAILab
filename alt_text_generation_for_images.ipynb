    "# Alt text generation for images\n",
    "On serlo.org we have a lot of images without alternative texts that would help visually impaired people using screen readers. \n",
    "Let's have a look at how a machine learning model could help us automatically generating such alternative texts!\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular choice for such tasks seem to be the BLIP 2 models. Two options to try them are:\n",
    "## Use a Hugging Face inference endpoint \n",
    "This means the model runs on a Hugging Face server to which we send API requests. You find the code for that on the [model page](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large) (or [base](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base)) clicking on the button 'ðŸš€ Deploy' and then 'âš¡ Inference API'. To use it, you have to make a Hugging Face account and [create an access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).\n",
    "## Run the model locally\n",
    "Download the model from Hugging Face and run it where you are running this notebook, i.e. your computer or Google Colab.\n",
    "Running BLIP 2 seems to work on a normal computer, so we can do that and do not need to get a Hugging Face access token for the inference endpoint. \n",
    "### Function to run the model\n",
    "Now let's get to it and implement a function that takes the image URL and a model as input and outputs the generated alternative text:"
